Floating on the third floor of Palazzo Fendi, the 7 elegant private suites in this recently restored 17th-century villa will take your breath away. Close to Rome's Via Condotti fashion strip and a stone's throw from the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain, the Suites combine classicism with innovation as only Fendi can. The palazzo originally belonged to the noble Boncompagni Ludovisi family, but has been the headquarters of Fendi since 2005\.

Designed by Italian architect, Marco Costanzi, the sprawling space fuses Fendi's chic and creative aesthetic, but without robbing it off its coziness. While "geometry, dualism, color blocking, and, of course, material and craftsmanship" were embedded into the design, Fendi CEO chairman, Petro Beccari emphasizes that every effort was made to provide an "intimate space, a homey feeling."

They may vary in size and views, but every one of the suites has something special to offer, down to the furnishings.

The bed linens are Fendi Casa twisted and mercerized Mako-cotton satin. The bathroom flaunt Carrara marble walls, Fendi Casa twisted-terry bath linens and Diptyque toiletries. The Palazzo Suite which sleeps 2 to 4 people boasts Karl Lagerfeld's original prints of Rome's fountains and a work tablet created by Fendi's historic in-house fur atelier. And did we mention the Oak flooring?

Suites come with complimentary WiFi, breakfast and a private tour of Fendi's flagship store which is domiciled in the building. With priority reservations at Zuma Restaurant on the rooftop, you may never leave the palazzo.
